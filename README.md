# Azure
In this repository you will find my templates for Azure deployments, usually for [Terraform](#terraform).

## Terraform
When it comes to Terraform, I prefer to put whole code of a small purpose-built module in a single file to make it easier to see all resources at glance and use `Ctrl+F`.
It also reduces number of files one has to open in the editor.
